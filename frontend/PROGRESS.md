## Firebase Security Rules Deployment

### How to deploy Firestore security rules

1. Install Firebase CLI if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. Login to Firebase:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. Initialize Firebase in your project (if not already done):
   ```bash
   firebase init firestore
   ```

4. Update the `firestore.rules` file with our security rules:
   ```
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       // Allow authenticated users to read and write to builds they own
       match /builds/{buildId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
         // Allow creating new builds if the user is authenticated and sets themselves as the owner
         allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
       }
       
       // Allow users to read and write their own user profiles
       match /users/{userId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
       }
       
       // Allow authenticated users to read public configuration
       match /config/{document=**} {
         allow read: if request.auth != null;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. Deploy the rules:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

### How to fix Firebase permission errors

If you're experiencing "Missing or insufficient permissions" errors, check the following:

1. Ensure you're authenticated before accessing Firestore
2. Verify that the current user's UID matches the `userId` field in the document you're trying to access
3. Make sure your security rules allow the specific operation you're attempting (read, write, create, etc.)
4. Check the Firebase console for any error messages in the Authentication and Firestore sections

## Notes for Deployment

- The frontend application requires a Firebase project with Authentication and Firestore enabled
- The GitHub Actions workflow requires a repository with the Flutter WebView template
- Environment variables need to be properly configured for:
  - Firebase client configuration
  - Firebase admin configuration
  - GitHub token and repository
  - Stripe configuration
